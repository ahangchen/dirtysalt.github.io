<h2 id="orgheadline1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Where is the Innovation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Microsoft, mostly. Exercise: Compare 1990 Microsoft software with 2000.</li>
<li>If you claim that’s not innovation, but copying, <b>I reply that Java is to C++ as Windows is to the Macintosh: an industrial response to an interesting but technically flawed piece of systems software.</b></li>
<li>If systems research was relevant, we’d see new operating systems and new languages making inroads into the industry, the way we did in the ’70s and ’80s.</li>
<li>Instead, we see a thriving software industry that largely ignores research, and a research community that writes papers rather than software.</li>
<li>Linux
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Innovation? New? No, it’s just another copy of the same old stuff.</li>
<li>OLD stuff. Compare program development on Linux with Microsoft Visual Studio or one of the IBM Java/web toolkits.</li>
<li>Linux’s success may indeed be the single strongest argument for my thesis: The excitement generated by a clone of a decades-old operating system demonstrates the void that the systems software research community has failed to fill.</li>
<li>Besides, <b>Linux’s cleverness is not in the software, but in the development model</b>, hardly a triumph of academic CS (especially software engineering) by any measure.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Web caches, web servers, file systems, network packet delays, all that stuff. Performance, peripherals, and applications, but not kernels or even user-level applications.</li>
<li>Mostly, though, it’s just a lot of measurement; a misinterpretation and misapplication of the scientific method.</li>
<li><b>Too much phenomenology: invention has been replaced by observation. Today we see papers comparing interrupt latency on Linux vs. Windows. They may be interesting, they may even be relevant, but they aren’t research.</b></li>
<li>In a misguided attempt to seem scientific, there’s too much measurement: performance minutiae and bad charts.</li>
<li><b>By contrast, a new language or OS can make the machine feel different, give excitement, novelty. But today that’s done by a cool web site or a higher CPU clock rate or some cute little device that should be a computer but isn’t.</b></li>
<li>The art is gone. But art is not science, and that’s part of the point. <b>Systems research cannot be just science; there must be engineering, design, and art.</b></li>

<h2 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> What Happened?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
A lot of things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>PC
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even into the 1980s, much systems work revolved around new architectures (RISC, iAPX/432, Lisp Machines). No more. A major source of interesting problems and, perhaps, interesting solutions is gone.</li>
<li>Much systems work also revolved around making stuff work across architectures: portability. But when hardware’s all the same, it’s a non-issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Web
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The web happened in the early 1990s and it surprised the computer science community as much as the commercial one.</li>
<li>It then came to dominate much of the discussion, but not to much effect. Business controls it. (The web came from physicists and prospered in industry.)</li>
<li>Research has contributed little, despite a huge flow of papers on caches, proxies, server architectures, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Standards
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A huge amount of work, but if you don’t honor the standards you’re marginalized.</li>
<li>Estimate that 90-95% of the work in Plan 9 was directly or indirectly to honor externally imposed standards.</li>
<li>With so much externally imposed structure, there’s little slop left for novelty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Orthodoxy
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Today’s graduating PhDs use Unix, X, Emacs, and Tex. That’s their world. It’s often the only computing world they’ve ever used for technical work.</li>
<li><b>Twenty years ago, a student would have been exposed to a wide variety of operating systems, all with good and bad points.</b></li>
<li>New employees in our lab now bring their world with them, or expect it to be there when they arrive. That’s reasonable, <b>but there was a time when joining a new lab was a chance to explore new ways of working.</b></li>
<li><b>Narrowness of experience leads to narrowness of imagination.</b></li>
<li>The situation with languages is a little better. many curricula include exposure to functional languages, etc. but there is also a language orthodoxy: C++ and Java.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change of scale
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With so many external constraints, and so many things already done, much of the interesting work requires effort on a large scale. <b>Many person-years are required to write a modern, realistic system. That is beyond the scope of most university departments.</b></li>
<li><b>Also, the time scale is long: from design to final version can be five years. Again, that’s beyond the scope of most grad students.</b></li>
<li><b>This means that industry tends to do the big, defining projects operating systems, infrastructure, etc. and small research groups must find smaller things to work on.</b></li>
<li>Three trends result:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Don’t build, measure. (Phenomenology, not new things.)</li>
<li>Don’t go for breadth, go for depth. (Microspecialization, notsystems work.)</li>
<li>Take an existing thing and tweak it.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I believe this is the main explanation of the SOSP curve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unix
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New operating systems today tend to be just ways of reimplementing Unix. If they have a novel architecture and some do the first thing to build is the Unix emulation layer.</li>
<li>How can operating systems research be relevant when the resulting operating systems are all indistinguishable?</li>
<li>There was a claim in the late 1970s and early 1980s that Unix had killed operating systems research because no one would try anything else. At the time, I didn’t believe it. Today, I grudgingly accept that the claim may be true (Microsoft notwithstanding).</li>
<li>A victim of its own success: portability led to ubiquity. That meant architecture didn’t matter, so now there’s only one.</li>
<li>Linux is the hot new thing&#x2026; but it’s just another Unix.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Linux
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The holy trinity: Linux, gcc, and Netscape. Of course, it’s just another orthodoxy.</li>
<li>These have become icons not because of what they are, but because of what they are not: Microsoft.</li>
<li><b>But technically, they’re not that hot. And Microsoft has been working hard, and I claim that on many (not all) dimensions, their corresponding products are superior technically. And they continue to improve.</b></li>
<li>Linux may fall into the Macintosh trap: smug isolation leading to (near) obsolescence.</li>
<li>Besides, systems research is doing little to advance the trinity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Startups
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Startups are the dominant competition for academia for ideas, funds, personnel, and students. (Others are Microsoft, big corporations, legions of free hackers, and the IETF.)</li>
<li>In response, government-funded and especially corporate research is directed at very fast ‘return on investment’.</li>
<li><b>This distorts the priorities:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Research is bent towards what can make big money (IPO) in a year.</li>
<li>Horizon is too short for long-term work. (There go infrastructure and the problems of scale.)</li>
<li>Funding sources (government, industry) perceive the same pressures, so there is a vicious circle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stanford now encourages students to go to startups because successful CEOs give money to the campus. The new president of Stanford is a successful computer entrepreneur.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grandma
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Grandma’s on line. This means that the industry is designing systems and services for ordinary people.</li>
<li>The focus is on applications and devices, not on infrastructure and architecture, the domain of systems research.</li>
<li>The cause is largely marketing, the result a proliferation of incompatible devices. You can’t make money on software, only hardware, so design a niche gimmick, not a Big New Idea.</li>
<li>Programmability - once the Big Idea in computing - has fallen by the wayside.</li>
<li>Again, systems research loses out.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Things to Do</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go back to thinking about and building systems. Narrowness is irrelevant; breadth is relevant: it’s the essence of system.</li>
<li>Work on how systems behave and work, not just how they compare. Concentrate on interfaces and architecture, not just engineering.</li>
<li>Be courageous. Try different things; experiment. Try to give a cool demo.</li>
<li>Funding bodies: fund more courageously, particularly long-term projects. Universities, in turn, should explore ways to let students contribute to long-term projects.</li>
<li>Measure success by ideas, not just papers and money. Make the industry want your work.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Things to Build</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
There are lots of valid, useful, interesting things to do. I offer a small sample as evidence. If the field is moribund, it’s not from a lack of possibilities.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Only one GUI has ever been seriously tried, and its best ideas date from the 1970s. (In some ways, it’s been getting worse; today the screen is covered with confusing little pictures.) Surely there are other possibilities. (Linux’s interface isn’t even as good as Windows!)</li>
<li><b>There has been much talk about component architectures but only one true success: Unix pipes. It should be possible to build interactive and distributed applications from piece parts.</b></li>
<li><b>The future is distributed computation, but the language community has done very little to address that possibility.</b></li>
<li>The Web has dominated how systems present and use information: the model is forced interaction; the user must go get it. Let’s go back to having the data come to the user instead.</li>
<li><b>System administration remains a deeply difficult problem. Unglamorous, sure, but there’s plenty of room to make a huge, even commercial, contribution.</b></li>
</ul>
