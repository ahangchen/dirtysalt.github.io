<p>
So, how did I learn so much stuff about Oracle?  <b>It started by immersing myself into a universe where every working day I had to solve somebody’s real Oracle problems. Uncomfortable, but effective.</b>
</p>

<p>
I tell my children, there’s only one place where money comes from: other people. <b>Money comes only from other people.</b> So many things in life are that way.
</p>

<p>
So, to my new LinkedIn friend, here’s my advice. Here’s what worked for me:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Educate yourself. Read, study, experiment. Educate yourself especially well in the fundamentals. So many people don’t. Being fantastic at the fundamentals is a competitive advantage, no matter what you do. If it’s Oracle you’re interested in learning about, that’s software, so learn about software: about operating systems, and C, and linkers, and profilers, and debuggers, &#x2026;. Read the Oracle Database Concepts guide and all the other free Oracle documentation. Read every book there is by Tom Kyte and Christian Antognini and Jonathan Lewis and Tanel Põder and Kerry Osborne and Karen Morton and James Morle all the other great authors out there today. And read their blogs.</li>
<li>Find a way to hook yourself into a network of people that are willing and able to help you. You can do that online these days. You can earn your way into a community by doing things like asking thoughtful questions, treating people respectfully (even the ones who don’t treat you respectfully), and finding ways to teach others what you’ve learned. <b>Write. Write what you know, for other people to use and improve. And for God’s sake, if you don’t know something, don’t act like you do. That just makes everyone think you’re an asshole, which isn’t helpful.</b></li>
<li><b>Immerse yourself into some real problems.</b> Read Scuttle Your Ships Before Advancing if you don’t understand why. You can solve real problems online these days, too (e.g., StackExchange and even Oracle.com), although I think that it’s better to work on real live problems at real live customer sites. Stick with it. Fix things. Help people.</li>
</ul>
