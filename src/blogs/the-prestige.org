#+title: 致命魔术(The Prestige)

Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: the magician shows you something ordinary, but of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn. The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret...you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.

每一项伟大魔术的完成，都与三个过程密不可分：一为“验证”，魔术师展示了看似平常、实则已经动过手脚的表演道具；二为“转移”，魔术师手中看似普通的事物，瞬间变得与众不同，这个时候，如果你想找魔术背后的秘密……那几乎是不可能的，这也是为什么还会有第三步；三为“蒙蔽”，这也是魔术中最关键的环节，是魔术师利用技巧进行掩饰的过程，一旦达成某种平衡，就会产生那种前所未见、让你无比震惊的现象--也就是魔术。
