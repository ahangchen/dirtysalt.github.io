#+title: The Seasones Schemer

- Indeed, "LISP" originally stood for "LISt Processing." By the same token, I suppose that the C programming language could have been called CHAP(for "CHAracter Processing") and Fortran could have been FLOP(for "FLOating-point Processing").
- While lists are the heart of Lisp, functions are the soul.
- 可以认为Y-combinator是一种特殊形式的(define ...), 但是很明显(define ...)比Y-combinator更加可读。在函数体内进行define的话可以使用letrec(let recursively. 递归绑定)
- Use (letrec ...) 1) to remove arguments that do not change for recursive applications. 2) to hide and to proect functions.
- Use (letcc ...)[call-with-current-continuation] to return values abruptly and promptly.
- Use (let ...) 1) to name the values of repeated expressions. 2) in a function definition if they may be evaluated twice for one and the same use of the function.
- A LISP programmer knows the value of everything but the cost of nothing - Alan J. Perlis.
